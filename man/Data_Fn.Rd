Data_Fn(Version, FieldConfig, ObsModel = 2, b_i, a_i, s_i, t_i, a_xl,

  Q_ik = NULL, Aniso = 1, RhoConfig = c(Beta1 = 0, Beta2 = 0, Epsilon1 =

  CheckForErrors = TRUE, Alpha = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{Version}{a version number (see example for current default).}

\item{FieldConfig}{a vector of format c("Omega1"=0, "Epsilon1"=10, "Omega2"="AR1", "Epsilon2"=10), where Omega refers to spatial variation, Epsilon refers to spatio-temporal variation, Omega1 refers to variation in encounter probability, and Omega2 refers to variation in positive catch rates, where 0 is off, "AR1" is an AR1 process, and >0 is the number of elements in a factor-analysis covariance}

\item{ObsModel}{an optional integer that specifies the distribution for positive catch rates (Default=2, i.e., Gamma)
\describe{
  \item{ObsModel=0}{Normal}
  \item{ObsModel=1}{Lognormal}
  \item{ObsModel=2}{Gamma}
  \item{ObsModel=11}{Mixture lognormal}
  \item{ObsModel=12}{Mixture gamma}
  \item{ObsModel=4}{Zero-adjusted negative binomial}
  \item{ObsModel=5}{Zero-inflated negativee binomial}
  \item{ObsModel=6}{Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution}
}}

\item{b_i}{Sampled biomass for each observation i}

\item{a_i}{Sampled area for each observation i}

\item{s_i}{Spatial knot (e.g., grid cell) for each observation i}

\item{t_i}{Time interval (e.g., year) for each observation i}

\item{a_xl}{Area associated with each knot}

\item{MeshList, }{tagged list representing location information for the SPDE mesh hyperdistribution}

\item{GridList, }{tagged list representing location information for the 2D AR1 grid hyperdistribution}

\item{Method, }{character (either "Mesh" or "Grid") specifying hyperdistribution (Default="Mesh")}

\item{v_i}{OPTIONAL, sampling category (e.g., vessel or tow) associated with overdispersed variation for each observation i}

\item{PredTF_i}{OPTIONAL, whether each observation i is included in the likelihood (PredTF_i[i]=0) or in the predictive probability (PredTF_i[i]=1)}

\item{X_xj}{OPTIONAL, matrix of static density covariates (e.g., measured variables affecting density, as used when interpolating density for calculating an index of abundance)}

\item{X_xtp}{OPTIONAL, array of dynamic (varying among time intervals) density covariates}

\item{Q_ik}{OPTIONAL, matrix of catchability covariates (e.g., measured variables affecting catch rates but not caused by variation in species density) for each observation i}

\item{Aniso}{OPTIONAL whether to assume isotropy (Aniso=0) or geometric anisotropy (Aniso=1)}

\item{RhoConfig}{OPTIONAL, vector of form c("Beta1"=0,"Beta2"=0,"Epsilon1"=0,"Epsilon2"=0) specifying whether either intercepts (Beta1 and Beta2) or spatio-temporal variation (Epsilon1 and Epsilon2) is structured among time intervals}

\item{Options}{OPTIONAL, a vector of form c('SD_site_density'=0,'SD_site_logdensity'=0,'Calculate_Range'=0,'Calculate_evenness'=0,'Calculate_effective_area'=0), where Calculate_Range=1 turns on calculation of center of gravity, and Calculate_effective_area=1 turns on calculation of effective area occupied}

\item{CheckForErrors}{OPTIONAL, whether to check for errors in input (NOTE: when CheckForErrors=TRUE, the function will throw an error if it detects a problem with inputs.  However, failing to throw an error is no guaruntee that the inputs are all correct)}

\item{Alpha}{order of SPDE mesh (default = 2, alternative = 1)}
}
\value{
Tagged list containing inputs to function Build_TMB_Fn()
}
\description{
\code{Data_Fn} builds a tagged list of data inputs used by TMB for running the model
